# RESISTOR COLOR

👨🏻‍💻 Solution using Javascript 👨🏻‍💻

## Description

Resistors have color coded bands, where each color maps to a number. The first 2 bands of a resistor have a simple encoding scheme: each color maps to a single number.

These colors are encoded as follows:

- Black: 0
- Brown: 1
- Red: 2
- Orange: 3
- Yellow: 4
- Green: 5
- Blue: 6
- Violet: 7
- Grey: 8
- White: 9

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to create a way:

- to look up the numerical value associated with a particular color band
- to list the different band colors

## Input

```
🥚 "red" 🥚 (String)
```

## Output

```
🐣 2 🐣 (Integer)
```

## Explanation

```
 1# ["black","brown","red",.......]
