# RESISTOR COLOR

The solution to this problem is written in JavaScript the detail about the problem is below and you can check the solution above.

## 💬 Description 💬

Resistors have color coded bands, where each color maps to a number. The first 2 bands of a resistor have a simple encoding scheme: each color maps to a single number.

These colors are encoded as follows:

-   Black: 0
-   Brown: 1
-   Red: 2
-   Orange: 3
-   Yellow: 4
-   Green: 5
-   Blue: 6
-   Violet: 7
-   Grey: 8
-   White: 9

## 🏁 Goal 🏁

The goal of this exercise is to create a way:

-   to look up the numerical value associated with a particular color band
-   to list the different band colors

## 🥚 Input 🥚
